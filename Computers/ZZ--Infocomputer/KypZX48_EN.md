Important: The esxDOS v0.8.8 files must be copied to the SD card, which you can download here:
http://www.esxdos.org/index.html

You have to copy the two folders BIN and SYS, nothing else. It is possible that you already have those folders but they will surely be from a previous version and they will not work (in that case it will hang when starting or error messages will appear or the DivMMC will work badly).

Block Scroll - VGA / RGB switch
F12 - OSD
F11 - Reset (press and hold SPACE to detect the SD card or make any changes)
F5 - NMI (DivMMC browser)
You can also do the reset with Ctrl-Alt-Del
